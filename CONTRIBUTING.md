## How to contribute to Subsetter

Subsetter is maintained primarily by its original author [msg555](https://github.com/msg555). If you're interested in contributing

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/msg555/subsetter/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/msg555/subsetter/issues/new).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* If the patch would be substantial please open an issue first so the problem and solution can be discussed beforehand.

* Otherwise for small patches open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before requesting a review please ensure that automated testing passes.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Create an issue that describes the new feature.

* If the feature is agreed upon create a pull request that implements it and references that issue.

* The merits of a feature should be discussed in an issue. Pull request feedback will be limited to the technical implementation in the request.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the subsetter documentation?**

* Documentation contributions are welcome. Documentation updates can be made by opening a new pull request with the changes.

Thanks!
